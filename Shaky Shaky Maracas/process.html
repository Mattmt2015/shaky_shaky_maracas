    <h1>How Our Maracas are Made:</h1>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Wood is harvested from a local Iowan Ironwood Tree Farm</li>
        <li>The harvested wood is transported to our warehouse where it is cut into blocks</li>
        <li>The wood blocks are then carved into the shape of a maraca</li>
        <li>The maracas are then filled with our secret, after being cut in half and then glued together</li>
        <li>The shaped maracas are sanded and shipped off to our painting part of our warehouse</li>
