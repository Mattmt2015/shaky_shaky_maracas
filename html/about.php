    <h1><u>About Us</u></h1>
    
    <p>Shaky Shaky Maracas was founded on August 31st, 2017 by Karson Richardson and Drew Geisert. 
    The company is based in the heart of America: Indianola, Iowa</p>
    
    <p>Karson and Drew are students at Simpson College who are looking for a start in the
     business world by selling a unique and exquisite product. The idea of starting        
     a business did not occur to the two ambitious men until they finished making their first batch 
     of hand made maracas, which gained a lot of popularity in their hometown of Indianola, Iowa. 
     They opened their first official Shaky Shaky Maracas store in Indianola on March 12th, 2017, in which 
     they kept and sold their hand made maracas.</p>
