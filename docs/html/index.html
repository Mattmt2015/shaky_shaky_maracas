    <p>We are a start up company new to the maraca selling game. We are growing fast and in a few years we hope to be the leading maraca supplier in the          Midwest, and then the United States. No other maraca supplier can match the quality of our maracas. They are hand-painted and show supreme craftsmanship.     For more information about how our maracas are made, visit our <a href="process.html">How Our Maracas Are Made</a> link. We even have a specially made        maraca that is indestructible. We ran these maracas over with a car and they still wouldn't break.</p>

    <h1 style = "border:4px solid #EB7F23; padding: 5px; text-align: center; font-family: arial, sans-serif;">History of Maracas</h1>
    
    <p>No one knows exactly when and where maracas were invented. We do know that they came from the native tribes of Latin America. They would take fruit from
    a Calabash tree, extract the pulp inside, and then place seeds or pebbles inside the fruit's shell. At Shaky Shaky Maracas, we hand carve our maracas
    from wood. This makes them extra strong and produces a much higher quality sound. Maracas are still a popular part of Latin American
    music today. What makes maracas so special is that nearly everyone can play them, which is why they are often a young child's first toy. Maracas
    are one of the most underrated instruments on the market today, and Shaky Shaky Maracas would be honored to become your premier maraca supplier.</p>
